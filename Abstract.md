# Types vs Tests
 
Tab vs spaces, vim vs emacs, types vs tests, our community is full of these conflicts.
In this talk I would like to discuss the latter: what is the impact of types in our programs? 
Can types help write more efficient tests? if so, how?

We'll go through some basic type theory and concrete examples in order to see how types can constrain
the design space. More importantly, we will learn how to select the right type for the job.
